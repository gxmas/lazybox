# 📥 lazybox

**Run a fleet of coding agents from your terminal — and step in when it
matters.** Every task gets its own isolated git worktree and a live embedded
terminal for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, or a shell, so you can spin up and
juggle many agents without ever managing worktrees by hand. Useful even with a
quiet GitHub.

Wire up GitHub or Linear and it's also a **reactive inbox**: instead of
refreshing, events flow to you — new comments, CI failures, and review requests
surface as they land, with per-row read/unread tracking.

Think a TUI inbox (lazygit-style) where every row is also a ready-to-run
workspace — built for developers juggling many PRs and AI coding agents at once.

<sub>Video not playing? Here's the [animated GIF](demo/hero.gif) and a [static screenshot](demo/hero.png). There's also a fully reproducible `--test` demo — code, not a recording — driven by [`demo/lazybox.tape`](demo/lazybox.tape).</sub>

## ✨ Highlights

- **📨 Reactive inbox** — new comments, CI failures, and review requests surface automatically, with per-row read/unread tracking. No refreshing.
- **🌳 A worktree per task** — every row opens an isolated git worktree, so PRs never step on each other's working trees.
- **🤖 Agents built in** — spawn Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor in a row's worktree from a fast which-key menu; `w w` picks the right prompt for the row's state (fix CI / address comments / implement issue).
- **🖥️ Embedded terminals** — a live PTY per workspace (split & tile them), powered by a vendored ghostty VT parser.
- **🔌 Source-agnostic** — GitHub and Linear today, surfacing in one inbox behind the same interface, with an optional Slack mirror.
- **🛰️ Remote-friendly** — a client/daemon split runs over an SSH-forwarded socket for working against a remote box.

## Requirements

Running a prebuilt binary needs almost nothing: the
[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), logged in (`gh auth login`), so lazybox
can read `gh auth token` for real GitHub-backed runs — `lazybox --test` skips
it entirely.

Building from source additionally needs:

- **Rust 1.88+** (via [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs)) — the pinned toolchain
  lives in `rust-toolchain.toml`
- **A C/C++ toolchain** — links the embedded ghostty terminal and the bundled
  SQLite
- **git, curl, tar, sha256sum/shasum** — `make setup` uses these to fetch and
  checksum-verify a pinned Zig toolchain
- **Linux only: libc++ and libc++abi** — the embedded ghostty terminal is
  built by Zig against LLVM's libc++, not GNU libstdc++; distro install
  commands are under [Install](#install)

Zig itself isn't something you install — `make setup` downloads the exact
pinned 0.15.2 build into `~/.cache/lazybox/zig/`, so no system Zig is required
or used.

## Install

Prebuilt binaries (macOS arm64/x86_64 and Linux x86_64):

```sh
brew install AntoineToussaint/lazybox/lazybox
# …or: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
#   https://github.com/AntoineToussaint/lazybox/releases/latest/download/lazybox-tui-installer.sh | sh
```

Then `gh auth login` (if you haven't) and run `lazybox`.

Prefer to build it yourself, or hacking on lazybox? Build from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AntoineToussaint/lazybox.git
cd lazybox
make setup     # one online preparation of pinned Zig, Ghostty, and Cargo caches
make run       # build + run
make release   # optimized build; strictly offline after setup
```

**Prerequisites:** Rust 1.88+, a C compiler (for bundled SQLite), the
[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) logged in (`gh auth login` — lazybox reads
`gh auth token`) for real GitHub-backed runs. `lazybox --test` does not require
`gh`. Network access is used by `make setup` once; the pinned Zig archive is
checksum-verified and Ghostty/Cargo sources are cached under
`~/.cache/lazybox/`. After setup, `make release` enables Cargo offline mode and
does not fetch dependencies.

Linux also needs a C/C++ toolchain plus **libc++ and libc++abi** — the embedded
ghostty terminal is built by zig against LLVM's libc++ (not GNU libstdc++), so
the link step fails without them. `make setup` checks for these and points you
at the right command for your distro:

```sh
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libc++-dev libc++abi-dev
# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install gcc gcc-c++ pkgconf-pkg-config libcxx-devel libcxxabi-devel
# Arch
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel pkgconf libc++ libc++abi
```

Full install options (Homebrew, `curl | sh`, source), build notes, and
troubleshooting are in the [Quickstart](https://lazybox.ai/docs/tutorials/quickstart/).
Release history is in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md), and private vulnerability
reports follow [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

## First 60 seconds

Want to see the UI immediately, with no GitHub account and nothing to configure?

```sh
lazybox --test     # throwaway tempdir repo + one seeded workspace, no GitHub
```

You land on the inbox. Then:

```
↑ / ↓     move between workspaces   (j / k also works)
Enter     open the selected workspace
w w       put your default agent to work in its worktree   (s for a plain shell)
]]q       leave the terminal, back to the inbox
```

`w` opens the work menu; `w w` picks the right prompt for the row's state and needs the agent's CLI
(e.g. `claude`) on your `PATH`; `s` (a plain shell) always works. To pick an
agent explicitly, `a` opens the agent menu (`a c` Claude · `a x` Codex ·
`a u` Cursor).

That's the whole model in one screen: the workspace got an **isolated git
worktree** and a **live embedded terminal**, and you never left the inbox.
Run `lazybox` (no `--test`) to do the same against your real PRs — the first
launch walks you through a short setup wizard. Run `lazybox --help` any time for
an orientation of every command.

## Essential keys

The bottom hint bar always shows what's available in the focused pane. Press `?`
for Ask Lazybox—type to search the live keymap or ask a workflow question, then
press `?` again for the compact index. lazybox is also fully mouse-driven—click a pane or row
to focus it, drag the splitters to resize, wheel-scroll, and right-click links
(or rows) for the context menu. The keys you'll reach for first:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Tab` | Cycle Sidebar → Activity → Terminals |
| `↑` / `↓` · `Enter` | Navigate the inbox (`j` / `k` also works) · open a workspace |
| `a` · `s` | Agent menu (which-key popup): `a c` Claude · `a x` Codex · `a u` Cursor · `s` spawns a shell (`a c` needs the `claude` CLI on `PATH`; `s` always works) |
| `w` | Work menu (which-key popup): `w w` uses the default/running agent · `w c` Claude · `w x` Codex · `w u` Cursor · `w S/M/L` chooses a model tier |
| `x` | Workspace menu: `x n` new workspace · `x p` new project · `x a` adopt sessions · `x j` join into PR · `x z` long snooze · `x x` archive · `x c` close issue |
| `m` · `r` | Mark read · reply |
| `g` | GitHub menu (which-key popup): `g m` merge · `g g` auto-merge on green · `g r` reviewers · `g a` assignees · `g l` labels · `g o` open in browser |
| `,` · `?` · `q q` | Settings · Ask Lazybox · quit |
| `]]` | Terminal leader (which-key popup): `]]q` back to the sidebar · `]]s` snippets · `]]f` focus mode · `]]\|` / `]]-` split · `]]x` close |

Power moves, once the basics feel natural:

- **Model tiers** — `w S` / `w M` / `w L` (and `a S` / `a M` / `a L`) run the agent at a small / medium / large model; Claude ships a Haiku/Sonnet/Opus menu, others configure theirs under `agents.<id>.models`. The picked tier rides a `◆ Opus` tab badge.
- **Multi-select + broadcast** — `v` marks sidebar rows, `Shift-B` sends one instruction (snippet or free text) to every selected workspace at once.
- **Focus mode** — `.` (or `]]f` from a terminal) near-fullscreens the agent terminal; `]]<digit>` jumps straight to the Nth agent workspace.
- **On main** — `b` leader (`b c` / `b s`, confirmed first) runs an agent or shell on the repo's shared main checkout instead of a worktree; the tab carries a `⎇ main` badge.
- **Jump anywhere** — `` ` `` opens a fuzzy workspace picker across all repos (from a terminal: `]]` then `` ` ``); `!` jumps to an agent waiting on input, `Shift-F` to failing CI.
- **Themes & messages** — `t` opens a live-preview theme picker; `Shift-M` shows the log of recent footer notices.
- **Snippets** — reusable prompts in `~/.lazybox/snippets.yaml` (plus repo-local `.lazybox/snippets.yaml`), sent via `]]s`; see [`docs/snippets.md`](docs/snippets.md).

The [full keybinding reference](https://lazybox.ai/docs/reference/keybindings/) covers every pane.

## Status

Pre-1.0, **early-adopter dev mode**. Daily-driver for the author on macOS; Linux
runs the same code paths but gets less testing. Expect sharp edges, log spam in
`/tmp/lazybox.log`, and the occasional breaking change. Prebuilt binaries ship
via the Homebrew tap, the `curl | sh` installer, and GitHub Releases (see
[Install](#install)).

Run a side-by-side dev instance against its own state with `make dev`
(`LAZYBOX_HOME=~/.lazybox-dev`) if you want to try lazybox without disturbing your
main inbox.
